# homecontroller
Personal project to move all tools on my RaspberryPi to Docker. [Photos OS](https://github.com/vmware/photon) is used as host OS (due to minimal footprint and security focus). Docker will be running in [swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/) to keep the number of installed packeges as low as possible while I can still use compose files with [Docker stack](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack/).
